## Fourier Series

The Fourier Series is a way to represent a function as the sum of simple sine waves.  It is used as a means to represent a periodic signal as an infinite sum of sine wave components.  A complicated signal can be broken down into simple waves which is the basis of Fourier Transforms.  Fourier transforms express a signal in terms of the frequences of the waves that constitute that signal.
